# AutoCAD ObjectARX Application - Add Line
 
## Overview
 
This ObjectARX application defines a function called `addLine` that efficiently inserts a straight line into the current drawing's Model Space using the ObjectARX API. The function takes care of proper resource handling, ensuring efficient memory management.
 
## Functionality
 
The `addLine` function performs the following steps:
 
1. **Get the Current Database:**
   - Retrieves the current drawing's database by obtaining a pointer to it.
 
2. **Open the Block Table for Read-Only:**
   - Allows read-only access to the Block Table, which holds information about blocks in the drawing.
 
3. **Get the Model Space Block:**
   - Retrieves the Block Table Record for the Model Space, a special block where drawing entities are typically placed.
 
4. **Define Start and End Points for the Line:**
   - Specifies the 3D coordinates for the start and end points of the new line.
 
5. **Create a New Line Object:**
   - Allocates memory for a new AcDbLine object, representing a straight line entity in AutoCAD.
 
6. **Append the Line to Model Space:**
   - Adds the newly created line object to the Model Space Block Table Record, effectively placing the line in the drawing.
 
7. **Close Model Space Block:**
   - Closes the Model Space Block Table Record, ensuring proper resource handling.
 
8. **Close the New Line Object:**
   - Releases resources associated with the new line object, an essential step in memory management.
 
## Usage
 
1. **Build and Load:**
   - Open the ObjectARX project in Microsoft Visual Studio.
   - Build the project and load the resulting DLL in AutoCAD.
 
2. **Run the Command:**
   - In AutoCAD, enter the custom command associated with the `addLine` function (e.g., "ADDLINE").
 
3. **View Results:**
   - The function will insert a straight line into the current drawing's Model Space.
